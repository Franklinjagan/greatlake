</div><div class="underlinetext">
Termination of Services by Greatlakes. If you have materially breached any provision of the Terms, or if Greatlakes is required to do so by law (e.g., where the provision of the Website, the Application, or the Services is, or becomes, unlawful), Greatlakes has the right to immediately suspend any Services and licenses provided to you under this Agreement (“Suspension”). Following Suspension, Greatlakes and your applicable entity will work together in good faith to determine whether to reinstate your access to (and any associated licenses to) the Services or permanently terminate your Services. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Greatlakes may terminate your account immediately in its sole discretion in the event that (a) you are a repreat infringer for purposes of Greatlakes’s copyright infringement policy as described in Section 11 or (b) you violate any restriction of these Terms after Greatlakes makes reasonable efforts to provide you with notice of a previous violation. You agree that Greatlakes shall not be liable to you or any third-party for any Suspension or termination of your Account made in accordance with the Terms. Termination or Suspension of any Service includes removal of access to such Service and barring of further use of the Service.

</div><div class="underlinetext">
GENERAL PROVISIONS.
</div><div class="underlinetext">
Electronic Communications. The communications between you and Greatlakes use electronic means, whether you visit the Greatlakes Properties or send Greatlakes e-mails, or whether Greatlakes posts notices on the Greatlakes Properties or communicates with you via e-mail.

If you are a California resident, you hereby waive California Civil Code Section 1542, which states, “A general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his favor at the time of executing the release, which, if known by him must have materially affected his settlement with the debtor.
</div><div class="underlinetext">
Assignment. The Terms, and your rights and obligations hereunder, may not be assigned, subcontracted, delegated, or otherwise transferred by you without Greatlakes’s prior written consent, and any attempted assignment, subcontract, delegation, or transfer in violation of the foregoing will be null and void.
