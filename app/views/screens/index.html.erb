       <h2>Pedagogy</h2>
    <h4>  Classroom learning</h4>
  The classroom sessions would adopt a case study approach to develop conceptual learning of management and analytics. In similar vein as the full time Programmes, the candidates would be required to cover their pre-readings and other associated learning material to be well prepared for these sessions. <br>
   
  <h4>Online Learning Management System (LMS)</h4>
  The online LMS would be used to host content and live webinars that will enable the candidates to continue their learning while not on campus. In addition to providing an enriching learning environment, the LMS would also encourage collaborative learning between the candidates.
   <br><br>
  <h4>Virtual Lab</h4>
  The virtual lab is a simulation environment that would be used by candidates for practicing exercises and assignments on tools such as SAS. The exposure on virtual lab would help candidates acquire hands on experience of analytical skills and techniques that are valued in the industry.
   <br><br>
  <h4>Industry Lectures</h4>
  Industry Lectures are a key aspect of the Programme as they complement the learning in class by actual case studies from the industry discussed by senior executives from leading analytics companies.
